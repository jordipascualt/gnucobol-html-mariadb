# gnucobol-html-mariadb
This project with GNUCobol is an intent to use html web pages to emulate IBM CICS 速 and also using Mariadb 速 (Mysql 速) as database server like using IBM DB2 速. So is fully base on free software. For better desing we use bootstrap 5.
NOTE: We will use Pseudoconversational transaction model. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudoconversational_transaction.

As far I test only works with Apache server.
